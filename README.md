### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Wei Xiong, currently a first-year Ph.D. student in computer science at UIUC. I work on RLHF for aligning language models. 

Previously, I have spent time on the mathematical foundation of RL, where I was fortunate to collaborate with many great senior mentors and talented peers. I also spent time on deep RL at Microsoft Research Asia.
