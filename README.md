### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Wei Xiong, currently a third and final-year Ph.D. candidate in computer science at UIUC. I work on the post training of generative models. 

Previously, I have spent time on the mathematical foundation of RL, where I was fortunate to collaborate with many great senior mentors and talented peers.
